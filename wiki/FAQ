=== Why not use performance counters? ===
Setting up performance counters can be a hassle and they are not cross-platform. Long-term, I would like to get this working on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_(software) Mono]. The idea is that you add it to your web.config and it just works.

=== Is this production ready? ===
The original intent of this project was to keep in touch with the performance of your application. If you introduce a data query that takes up 50% of the page processing time, this should be more apparent. I would not enable this on a production environment for security reasons. I run this strictly in my dev environment.

=== Does this take the place of profiling my code? ===
No it doesn't. Profiling will give a detailed breakdown for the performance of your application *as a whole without additional code*. StatsConsole gives you a breakdown of *a request's performance at points the developer decided on*.
